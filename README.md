# Investment-Thesis-Data-Analysis-Project

This project looks into whether investing in a company called Info-Print is a good decision or not by evaluating some of the key points that underpin a private equity firm's investment thesis. 

1) Data Pre-processing - Overview
- Cleaned the transaction data from 2015-2020 and conducted an initial exploratory analysis
- Visualized trends in the annual revenue generated by different customer types over the years
- Calculated annual revenue, annual profit and annual profit margin and created a seperate csv file called Financial Metrics. 

2) Determining Growth Drivers
- Recognized that there are 4 types of customers contributing to the company's annual growth rate: 
a. Churned customers
b. New customers
c. Upsell
d. Downsell
- Created functions and filtered data in Python to determine percentage contribution of each customer type to the annual growth rate.
- This analysis helped the private equity firm determine whether Info Prints claims on increasing the value of customers through upsell opportunities were true or not.
